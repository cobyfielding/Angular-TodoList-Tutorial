First Angular App
=====================

This is a Task App tutorial I followed along with on Scotch.io

## Making this project

This task app was built using Angular, Cordova, and Ionic.  After building the app I used PhoneGap to test it on my phone.  After following along with the tutorial I was still receiving several errors.  After debugging the issues I quickly realized that the tutorial was missing several methods necessary for the app to work.  After going through the tutorial I was able to have a good enough understanding to be able to debug and fix all of the issues.
